		<p class="aboutTxt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YouTooDj was originally created for a class project. Originially I had planned on doing a simple website about  lessons on certain CS subjects. To practicing my JavaScript I set out to create a project worthy of placing in my online porfolio. After being inpired by a weekend at Nocternal Wonderland 2017, I decided to change my project to a turn table like web app that worked with Youtube videos. To begin this project I first had to learn the Youtube developers Iframe API. After studying the content I was able to make a rough prototype of a working project. After establishing all the basic code for the different UI components, I noticed allot of similar code was being duplicated. To minimize the ammount of code that would have to be used, I redesigned the code several times to be able to reuse functions for different Youtbe Players. This redesign cuased many bugs, some of which are still not fixed.
